        What can I say about this guy?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Or rather, what can I NOT say! He's been through it, in it, behind it, around it, over it, under it, and on top of it all in that order. <br />
        I'm not joking around the bush here when I say BG is invited to my wedding (as the wife). What a guy!
      </p>
      <p>
        One time back in the 90s, Geeb and I were walking around the beaches of Aruba, holding hands, just talking about the universe and stuff. <b>When suddenly</b> <br/>
        BG smells a helpless family of beached GWSs (that's our acronym for great white sharks, I'll have to tell that story another time) 3 miles down the beach. <br />
        This guy rips his shirt off, 24 pack glistening, golden brown hair flowing in the wind, and <b>bolts</b> towards them. Not three bounds of his <br />
        stunning legs and he's there to assist the mister, missus, and cubs back into the water. We traded information and they have been our financial advisors <br />
        ever since. They come over for everything bagel pizza every Thursday. You should see Jack, the son, growing up so big and proud like his father. <br />
        His father, Jeremy (the financial advisor), said he's having a rough time in middle school because his third row of teeth haven't come in yet. I swear <br />
        teenage GWSs can be so vindictive. I mean for goodness sakes he's a stunning young boy with a fin that his father would be proud of. <br />
        Stacy was <b>furious</b> when she found out. Beejmaster offered to go give the bullies a talk (which I have no doubt would inspire them <br />
        to be better GWSs). Oh but there I go rambling again
