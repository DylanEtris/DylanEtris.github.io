        What can I say about this guy?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Or rather, what can I NOT say! He's been through it, in it, behind it, around it, over it, under it, and on top of it all in that order. <br />
        I'm not joking around the bush here when I say BG is invited to my wedding (as the wife). What a guy!
      </p>
      <p>
        One time back in the 90s, Geeb and I were walking around the beaches of Aruba, holding hands, just talking about the universe and stuff. <b>When suddenly</b> <br/>
        BG smells a helpless family of beached GWSs (that's our acronym for great white sharks, I'll have to tell that story another time) 3 miles down the beach. <br />
        This guy rips his shirt off, 24 pack glistening, golden brown hair flowing in the wind, and <b>bolts</b> towards them. Not three bounds of his <br />
        stunning legs and he's there to assist the mister, missus, and cubs back into the water. We traded information and they have been our financial advisors <br />
        ever since. They come over for everything bagel pizza every Thursday. You should see Jack, the son, growing up so big and proud like his father. <br />
        His father, Jeremy (the financial advisor), said he's having a rough time in middle school because his third row of teeth haven't come in yet. I swear <br />
        teenage GWSs can be so vindictive. I mean for goodness sakes he's a stunning young boy with a fin that his father would be proud of. <br />
        Stacy was <b>furious</b> when she found out. Beejmaster offered to go give the bullies a talk (which I have no doubt would inspire them <br />
        to be better GWSs). Oh but there I go rambling again

                Spatial blink. You need to listen for if Neck invokes his spatial blink. He can teleport short distances (by my measure up to 10 ft)
                but this tactic is given away by the shrill "aroo" he has to bleat out to perform it.

                Every 2 minutes Neck must consume three chicken breasts or revert to a puny form of hisself. If you can starve him at this two
                minute mark, he may easily be dispatched. He becomes feral at the 1:55 mark though, so I have never been able to accomlish this.

          <h4 class="heading">General Strategy</h4>
          <p>
            I recommend starting any encounter with <em>Pumpkins Scream in the Dead of Night</em>, which will
            render him distracted until Neck can be starved. This also has the benefit of turning Kyle's back
            to Neck, stunning Neck for a brief period. If Neck is not starved then hope is lost, but
            Kyle is a relatively easy target to take one-on-one.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="grid_6">
          <h4 class="heading">General Strategy</h4>
          <p>
            It is imperitive at all costs to render him puny by starving him two minutes. However, no
            paralysis effects work when he is in his feral state. I have been unable to starve him for long
            enough to do any real damage. His banshee cry and blink abilities synergize against you. If
            you prepare with ear muffs, you will not be able to hear his "aroo". I  have not found a way
            to counter this. Use methods of distraction to get him to the 1:55 mark, then do what you
            can to last 5 more seconds.

        Lastly, when they detect they are in a losing situation (which I have only accomplished two times in years of tracking them), they will employ
        a intimidation technique: releasing their hellhound. This is a test of character; He will read your soul and judge every decision you have made until that point.
        If you are deemed unworthy, I am unable to assist you. Be prepared to fight harder than you ever have for your life. I know of no survivors.

        <p class=>
          As you can see, these two guys form a powerful team out in the wild. I've been hunting them for years, but I barely get away every time I try.
          I'd like to say I have some profound, god-blessed reason for hunting these two, but the truth is simple: I just don't like them very much.

          Our story started three years ago when we were all on a scientific expedition in Antarctica. We were studying the effects of espresso beans on the
          local fauna, i.e. how many espresso beans can a polar bear realistically take before going down? Unfortunately, our results were regularly disrupted
          by Kyle punching the bears dead. But that wasn't what made me not like them.

          No siree Bob. The truth is they beat me at <em>Settlers of Catan</em>; And for that, their punishment
          is death.
